used to read flac tags and treat them 
in the same way that pzs-ng treats 
mp3 files. to apply the patch first make
sure that you have libFLAC installed,
on debian this is done with the following 
packages:

apt-get install libflac8 libflac-dev

once this is done, download ng_r2532
the version this is patched against. 
once extracted;

cd zipscript/src
patch -p1 -i /path/to/flac_source.patch

cd ../include
patch -p1 -i /path/to/flac_header.patch


report any issues you come across during 
patching.

next step is to ensure that you have the 
required libs needed in the chroot, to 
achieve this edit your copy of libcopy.sh 
(usually in glftpd root) and add "flac" 
to the list of required bins.

and then test ...
